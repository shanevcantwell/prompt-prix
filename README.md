# prompt-prix

**Find your optimal open-weights model.**

prompt-prix is a visual tool for running benchmark test suites across multiple LLMs simultaneously, helping you discover which model and quantization best fits your VRAM constraints and task requirements.

## The Problem

You have a 24GB GPU. Should you run `qwen2.5-72b-instruct-q4_k_m` or `llama-3.1-70b-instruct-q5_k_s` for tool calling? BFCL gives you leaderboard scores for full-precision models. That doesn't answer your question.

## The Solution

Run existing benchmarks against *your* candidate models, on *your* hardware, and see results side-by-side.

- **Fan-out dispatch**: Same test case → N models in parallel
- **Work-stealing scheduler**: Efficient multi-GPU utilization across heterogeneous workstations
- **Visual comparison**: Real-time streaming with Model × Test result grid
- **Benchmark-native**: Consumes BFCL and Inspect AI test formats directly

## Status

🚧 **Active Development**

The working codebase is on the [`development/testing`](https://github.com/shanevcantwell/prompt-prix/tree/development/testing) branch.

## Ecosystem Position

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [BFCL](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla) | Function-calling benchmark with leaderboard |
| [Inspect AI](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/) | Evaluation framework (UK AISI) |
| **prompt-prix** | Visual fan-out for model selection |

prompt-prix complements these tools—it's a visual layer for comparing models during selection, not a replacement for rigorous evaluation.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Adapter pattern**: OpenAI-compatible API now (LM Studio), extensible to Ollama/vLLM
- **Fail-fast validation**: Invalid benchmark files rejected immediately
- **Pydantic state management**: Explicit, typed, observable
- **Work-stealing dispatcher**: Asymmetric GPU setups handled automatically
